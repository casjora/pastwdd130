        <p>Hi, there! As a random fact about me I like my middle name better than my first name, so Rafael is my middle name.

            I like to learn new things, that's the reason I look for available courses in places like Coursera.

            I was born as a covenant child to my parents in Honduras, I'm 33 years old now. I served my mission in Costa Rica and got married when I turned 26. My wife is a great support to me in my pursue to achieve a "Software Developement" degree in BYU.

            I was very curious to find out what job opportunities could derive from this career path and was surprised in a good way to find out that web develpment is in a huge demand at this time and projections are very positive.
